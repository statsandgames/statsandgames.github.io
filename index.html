  <center><p>I like video game lists. Maybe time has passed me by, but I have little interest in watching video versions of lists - I like reading. I hate when I go to a news article and then a video starts loading instead of a written article. Maybe there are others out there like me. My plan is to replay old console games, starting with NES, and ranking them.</p></center>
